## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab-1

*This was a really fun lab, not only because it was easy but also because it set the foundation for other labs. Although it didn’t seem easy at the time, it is now probably one of the easiest assignments that we have done in this class. I also enjoyed working with my partner, it made making friends easier at this new school.

Lab-3 Part 1,

*This lab was probably my favorite because it was so fascinating and rewarding. I felt accomplished when our code finally worked when we tested it for calculating our BMR. It was incredible to see that our lines of code could turn into a program. 

Lab-3 Part 2,

*As a continuance of lab 3, this lab was really enjoyable due to its simplicity. Yet the outcome was extraordinary seeing how the simple lines of code can create this program. I liked how simple it was yet it can calculate how many days have passed since a certain date, it’s very simple math that you can search up but it was a nice practice.
